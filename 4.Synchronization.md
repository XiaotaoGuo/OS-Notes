# Synchronization

## Problem introduction

1. Introduction

    - synchronization: events happen at the same time
    - Process synchronization
      - Events in process that occur "at the same time"
      - one process have to wait for another
    - Usage
      - prevent race conditions
      - wait for resources to become available

2. **race condition**

    - race condition: two process which should run sequently accidentally run at the same time (which cause a bug)
    - To avoid race conditions:
      - identify related *critical sections*
        - Section of code excuted by different processes
        - critical sections must run *atomically* w.r.t each other
      - Enforce *mutual exclusion*
        - only one process is allowed to be active in critical section
    - *Atomic*
      - atomic means "indivisible"
      - effective atomicity
        - interrupt may occur, but it shouldn't has effect on that section caused by other processes
      - How to determine wether a critical section is atomic
        - Consider effect of critical section in isolation
        - Consider interruptions: if the result is same, then it is OK.
    - *Mutual exclusion*
      - Surrond critical section with entry/exit code
      - entry code act as a barrier
        - if another process is critical section, block current process till it exit
        - Otherwise, allow process to proceed
      - Exit code should release other entry barriers

3. __**Requirements for good solution**__

    - Given
      - multiple cooperating process
      - each with related critical sections
    - At most one process in a critical section
    - Can't prevent entry if no others in critical section
    - Should eventually be able to enter critical section
    - No assumptions about CPU speed or number.

## Different approaches for mutual exclusion (workable)

1. Peterson's solution

    - implementation

        ```C
        shared int turn;
        shared bool intent[2] = {false, false};

        // P0
        intent[0] = TRUE;
        turn = 1; turn = 0;
        while (intent[1] && turn==1);
        /*
        < critical section >
        */
        intent[0] = FALSE;

        // P1
        intent[1] = TRUE;
        while (intent[0] && turn==0);
        /*
        < critical section >
        */
        intent[1] = FALSE;
        ```

    - if competition occur, take turns, otherwise enter
    - for competing process number larger than 2, the solution will become more complex

2. Test-and-Set Lock Instruction: TSL

    - requirement: TSL mem

        ```C
        do atomically (i.e., locking the memory bus)
            [test if mem == 0 AND set mem = 1]
        ```

    - a possible C function implementation for TSL (it should be guaranteed atomic)

        ```C
        TSL(int *lockptr) {
            int oldval;
            oldval = *lockptr
            *lockptr = 1;
            return ((oldval == 0) ? 1 : 0);
        }
        ```

    - mutual exclusion  using TSL

        ```C
        shared int lock = 0;
        // P0
        while (! TSL(&lock));
        /*
        < critical section >
        */
        lock = 0;

        // P1
        while (! TSL(&lock));
        /*
        < critical section >
        */
        lock = 0;
        ```

    - shared variable solution using TSL(int *)
      - test if lock == 0 (if so, will return 1; else 0)
      - before returning, sets lock to 1
    - simple, works for any number of threads
    - still suffering from busy waiting

3. *Semaphores*

    - Synchronization varaible
      - takes on integer values (non-negative)
      - can cause a process to block/unblock
    - wait and signal operations (**must be atomic, use a lower-level mechanism**)
      - wait(s) block if zero, else decrement
      - signal(s) unblock a process if any, else increment
    - no other operations allowed (**cannot change/test value of semaphore**)

    - simple, works for n processes
    - busy-waiting still exist, but it lies inside semephore, which last shorter
    - Implementation

        ```C
        wait(sem s) {
            s.n = s.n â€“ 1;
            if (s.n < 0) {
                addProc (me, s.L); // add process to waiting list
                block (me);
            }
        }

        signal(sem s) {
            s.n = s.n + 1;
            if (!empty (s.L)) {
                p = removeProc (s.L); // select a process from waiting list to release
                unblock (p);
            }
        }
        ```

    - Only synchronization, no information transfer
      - no way for a process to tell it blocked

4. Usage of semaphore

   - basic usage example

        ```C
        sem mutex = 1;
        //P0
        wait(mutex);
        /*
        < critical section >
        */
        signal(mutex);

        //P1
        wait(mutex);
        /*
        < critical section >
        */
        signal(mutex)
        ```

   - order how processes execute

      ```C
      sem cond = 0;

      // P0
      /*
      < to be done before P1 >
      */
      signal(cond);

      // P1
      wait(cond);
      /*
      < to be done after P0 >
      */
      ```
