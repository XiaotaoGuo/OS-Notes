# Protection

## Basics

1. Introduction

    - Process access resources
    - Resources are shared, need to be protected

        - from process without permission
        - from improper access by a process

    - What is the right protection model?
    - What are the mechanism?

2. The kernel enforces protection

    - To pretect resources, have kernel "own" them, then kernel can allow access temporairily
    - To access a resource, a process must ask for it, then kernel can test whether access should be given
    - One a process is given access

        - kernel can prevent others for gaining access
        - kernel may/may not be able to take away access

    - This assumes kernel operates correctly

3. Protecting the kernel

    - The kernel itself must be protected
    - Mechanism

        - Memory protecion
        - Protected mode of operation: kernel vs. user
        - Clock interrupt, so kernel eventually gets control

    - Notice, mechanisms are hardware supported
    - Protected kernel can protect other resources

4. Goals supported by kernel

    - Allow range of permissions
    - Allow user to set/get them
    - Be fast/simple for common use
    - Support user expressing complex permissions

## Implementation

### Simple model

1. A formal model of protection

    - Protection: how to limit access to a resource
    - Resource: object that requires protection
    - Domain: set of (resource, permission) pairs
    - Process: accesses resources within domain

2. Protection Matrix

    - Example: (X, Y: Resources A,B: Domains)

        |   |  X  |  Y  | A | B |
        |---|---  | --- |---|---|
        | A | r,w | r,w |   |   |
        | B | w   | r   |   |   |

    - Can describe all domains as a matrix

        - Rows are domains
        - Columns are resources
        - Matrix entry [d, r] contains permissions/rights

    - Access Control Lists (For resource)

        - For each resource, list (domain, permissions) pairs
        - ACL is associated with resource
        - Like a registry: if name is on list, ok to access
        - Can be inefficient: must lookup on each access
        - Revocation is easy; just remove from list

    - Capability Lists (For domain)

        - For each domain, list (resource, permissions pairs)
        - Capability list associated with each domain
        - Like key/ticker: if you have it, you get access
        - Efficient: on access, just produce capability
        - Hard to revoke

### UNIX Protecion

1. Basic

    - Associated with each file is set of permissions

        - Permission bits r/w/x for owner, group, world
        - Limited form of access control list

    - Protection domain: UID (user account ID) + ...

        - A process is always in some domain

    - When process opens file, check permission
    - If ok, provide process with a capability

        - Future operations then carried out efficiently

2. More

    - For common case, r/w/x for o/g/w adequate
    - For special cases, can extend via user program
    - SETUID mechanism: causes domain switch
    - If executable file has SETUID bit set

        - Process runs in domain of owner (of executable)
        - Therefor, it runs with all the rights of the owner

3. Example

    - Pat has a file "Bil" of bibliography references
    - Chris wants to read and add entries
    - But, Chris lacks permissions (only Pat can r/w)
    - Pat wisher to allow append access (only add entris to the back), but how?
    - Solution:

        - Pat can provide program (e.g., EditBib): only reads/appends
        - Set permissions

            - of program: execute (for Chris), and SETUID on
            - of Bib file: read/write only for Pat, not Chris

        - When Chris executes EditBib, runs as Pat (since SETUID on, domain switch to Pat's domain)
        - Program only does read/append.
