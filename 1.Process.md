# Process

1. Definition

   - Abstraction of a running program (*dynamic*)
   - While program is just static code

2. Resources

    - CPU
      - Processing cycles (CPU time)
      - Execute intstructions
    - Memory
      - Bytes or words
      - maintain state
    - Other resources (I/O)

3. **Context of a Process (machine and kernel-related state)**

   - CPU context
     - PC (program counter)
     - SP (stack pointer)
     - FP (frame pointer)
     - GP (general pointer)
   - Memory context
     - program code
     - static variables(init, uninit)
     - heap
     - shared memory
     - stack of activation records
   - Other (kernel-related state, ...)

4. Process memory structure <img src="./imgs/process&#32;memory.png" width="120" style="float: right;">
   - Text area: code (program instruction)
   - Data
     - Global variable
     - Static variable (local and global)
     - Heap
   - Stack
     - Activation records
     - Automatic growth/shrinkage

5. Process stack <img src="./imgs/process&#32;stack.png" width="180" style="float: right;">
   - Stack of activation records
   - An activation records stores:
     - return address
     - link to previous record
     - local varibale
     - other
   - Stack pointer points to top

6. Multi-Processes
    - Goal: support several processes running "simultaneously" or let one process intentionally yield to another process
    - Method: Context switching
      - Switch process A (running) to process B (waiting) while store context (state) of process A (since it's not finished)
      - process
        - save context of current process
          - save GP
          - save SP
          - save PC
        - load context of next process
          - load GP
          - load SP
          - __load PC (must be last, once PC is loaded, the process B begins to run (PC indicates instruction execution))__
