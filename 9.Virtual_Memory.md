# Virtual Memory

## Review

1. Segments and Pages

    - Structuring memory as segements/pages allows:

        - partitioning memory for convenient allocation
        - reorganizing memory for convenient usage

    - Approaches

        - Relocation via address translation
        - Protection via matching operations with objects

    - Result: a logically organized memory

2. Optimization

    - Not all pieces need to be in memory

        - Need only piece being referenced
        - Other pieces can be on disk
        - Bring pieces in only when needed

    - Illusion: there is much more memory
    - Needed:

        - A way to identify whether a piece is in memory
        - A way to bring in a piece (from where to where?)
        - Relocation (address translation)

3. From logical to virtual memory

    - Logical memory becomes virtual memory

        - Still logical (seperate organization from physical)
        - Virtual: memory seems to exist, regardless of how (memory or disk)

    - Virtual memory: illusion of large memory

        - Keep only portion of logical memory in physical
        - Rest is kept on disk (larger, slower, cheaper)
        - Unit of memory is segment or page (or both)

    - Logical address space $\rightarrow$ virtual address space

## Virtual memory based on paging

1. Paged virtual memory

    - All of pages reside on disk
    - Some also reside in physical memory (which ones?)

2. Contents of page table entry

    - Valid: is entry valid (page in physical memory or not)
    - Ref: has this page been referenced yet?
    - Mod: has this page been modified?
    - Frame: what frame is this page in?
    - Prot: what are the allowable operations?

3. Address Translation

    - Process:

        - Get entry: index page table with page number
        - If valid bit is off, which cause a page fualt, then trap into kernel

            - Find page on disk
            - Read it into a free frame

                - may need to make room if there is no available frame: page replacement

            - Record frame number in page table entry
            - Set valid bit and other fields

        - Retry instruction (return from page-fault trap)

    - Possible faults under segmentation/paging

        - two kinds of address:
            - Virtual address: (segment s, page p, offset i)
            - Physical address: (frame f, offset i)

        - [ ] Use s to index segment table (to get page table)

            - may get a segment fualt

        - [ ] Check bound (Is p < bound?)

            - may get a segmentation violation

        - [ ] Use p to index page table (to get frame f)

            - may get a page fault

        - [ ] Physical address: concatenate f and i

    - Cost of page faults is high

        - Disk: 5 ~ 6 orders magnitude slower than RAM
        - Example:

            - RAM access time: 100 nsec
            - Disk access time: 10 msec
            - p = page fault probability
            - Effective access time: 100 + p * 10,000,000 nsec
            - if p = 0.1%, effective access time = 10,100 nsec (100 times slower!)

## Possible implementation

1. Principle of Locality

    - Not all pieces referenced uniformly over time

        - Make sure most referenced pieces in memory
        - If not, thrashing: constant fetching of pieces

    - References cluster in time/space

        - Will be same or neighboring areas
        - Allows prediction based on past

2. Page replacement policy

    - Goal: remove page not in locality of reference
    - Page replacement is about:

        - which page(s) to remove
        - when to remove them

    - How to do it in cheapest way possible, with:

        - least amount of additional hardware
        - least amount of software overhead

3. *Basic Page Replacement Algorithms*

    - FIFO: select page that is oldest

        - Simple: keep pointer to next frame after last loaded
        - Doesn't perform well (oldest may be popular)

    - OPT: Optimal Page Replacement

        - Optimal: replace page that will be accessed furthest in future
        - Not realistic:

            - Requires predicting the future
            - Useful as a benchmark

    - **LRU: Least Recently Used**

        - Replace page that was least recently used

            - LRU means used furthest in the past

        - Takes advantage of locality of reference
        - Must have some way of tracking frame with LRU page : requires hardware support

## Others

1. **Approximating LRU: Clock Algorithm**

    - Select page that is old and not recently used

        - Clock (second chance) is approximation of LRU

    - Hardware support: reference bit

        - Associated with each frame is a reference bit
        - Reference bit is in page table entry

    - How reference bit is used

        - When frame filled with page, set bit to 0 (by OS)
        - If frame is accessed, set bit to 1 (by hardware)

    - *Working process*

        - Arrange all frames in circle (clock)
        - Clock hand: next frame to consider
        - Page fault: find frame

            - If ref bit 0, select frame
            - Else, set ref bit to 0
            - Advance clock hand
            - If frame found, break out of loop, else repeat

        - If frame had modified page, must write it to disk

2. Resident Set Management

    - Resident set: process's pages in physical memory

        - One set per process
        - How big should resident set be? Which pages?
        - Who provides frame (same process or another)?

    - Local: limit frame selection to request process

        - Isolates effects of page behavior on processes
        - Inefficient: some processes have unused frames

    - Global: select any frame (from any process)

        - Efficient: resident sets grow/shrink accordingly
        - No isolation: process can negatively affect another (by replacing other process's important pages)

3. Multiprogramming Level

    - Multiprogramming level: number of processes in physical memory (non-empty resident sets)
    - Goal: increase multiprogramming level - how?
    - However, beyond certain point: thrashing (make processor utilization pretty low since many processes may not be working)
    - Resident set should contain the working set

4. Denning's Working Set Model

    - Introduction

        - Working set: $W(t, \Delta)$

            - Pages referenced during last delta (process time)

        - Process given frames to hold working set
        - Add/remove pages according to $W(t, \Delta)$
        - If working set doesn't fit, swap process out

    - Working set is a local replacement policy

        - Process's page fault behavior doesn't affect others

    - Problem: difficult to implement

        - Must timestamp pages in working set
        - Must determine if timestamp older than $t - \Delta$
        - How should $\Delta$ be determined?

    - Contrast to Clock

        - Clock: simple, easy to implement, global policy
